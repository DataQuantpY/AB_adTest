# Market A/B Testing Analysis

## Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of a digital advertising campaign using A/B testing and machine learning. By analyzing user engagement and conversion trends, we provide data-driven recommendations to optimize ad placement and maximize return on investment (ROI).

## Business Insights
- **Ad Timing Matters**: Customers are more likely to convert when exposed to ads on **Monday and Tuesday**. This suggests that targeting users at the beginning of the week leads to higher engagement.
- **Campaign Success Confirmation**: A statistical **Z-proportion one-tailed test** at a 5% significance level confirms that the ad campaign was successful.
- **Data Integrity**: The dataset was thoroughly validatedâ€”no duplicate users, missing values, or unexpected data anomalies were found.
- **Machine Learning Prediction ðŸ¤–**: A predictive model was trained to estimate the probability of a user converting after seeing an ad. The model achieved a strong **AUC score of 0.87**, demonstrating its efficacy in distinguishing between likely and unlikely converters. Additionally, a **ROC curve graph** is included in the notebook to visually represent the model's performance.

## Key Considerations
- **High False Positive Rate ðŸš¨**: The model generates a large number of false positives, meaning it predicts many users will convert when they actually wonâ€™t. However, given that the cost of targeting an unlikely converter is minimal compared to the potential gain, this trade-off can be acceptable.
- **Strategic Opportunity ðŸ’¡**: Businesses can use the model to **expand ad reach** while still maintaining cost-effectiveness, capitalizing on possible but less probable conversions.

## Business Benefits
### 1. Increased Revenue Potential
By **reallocating ad spend** to high-conversion days (Monday and Tuesday), businesses can maximize sales while reducing inefficient ad impressions.

### 2. Cost Optimization
Reducing ad spend on low-conversion days (e.g., later in the week) helps optimize marketing budgets, ensuring higher efficiency in campaign execution.

### 3. Data-Driven Decision Making
With solid statistical backing, businesses can **confidently implement strategic changes** without relying on assumptions, minimizing risk and uncertainty.

### 4. Smarter Targeting with AI ðŸŽ¯
Leveraging machine learning enables **better audience segmentation**, allowing businesses to tailor their ad strategy dynamically based on predictive analytics.

## Next Steps
- **A/B Testing Refinement**: Conduct additional tests to refine targeting by user demographics and device types.
- **Further Model Optimization**: Explore ways to reduce false positives without compromising the ability to identify high-value users.
- **Ad Frequency Adjustment**: Experiment with different ad frequency levels to find the optimal exposure rate per user.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights a **clear opportunity to improve conversion rates** through better ad scheduling and machine learning insights. By leveraging data-driven strategies, businesses can achieve higher ROI, better engage their audience, and make informed advertising decisions ðŸ“ŠðŸš€.
